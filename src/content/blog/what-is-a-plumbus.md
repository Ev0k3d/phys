Every home has one, yet few understand its true nature. The Plumbus, a household device so common that its presence is taken for granted across infinite dimensions, remains one of the most enigmatic inventions in the multiverse.

## The Basics

The Physics Society is a student-led community dedicated to exploring the frontiers of physics through interactive sessions, thought experiments, and weekly demonstrations. Each session challenges members to think critically, question assumptions, and explore concepts from classical mechanics to quantum phenomena.

## Society Structure and Setup

- **Core Members**: President: Steven Aaron, Vice-President, Secretary, and enthusiastic volunteers
- **Weekly Sessions**: Interactive experiments and discussions
- **Facilities**: School physics lab equipped with demonstration tools
- **Equipment**: Pendulums, lasers, Geiger Counter, Yo-Yos and more
- **Society Size**: Typically 12–30 students per session

## Session Highlights

Each Physics Society session contains unique experimental and theoretical properties:

1. **Thought Experiment Intensity**: Challenges members to stretch their imagination and understanding
2. **Concept Retention**: Hands-on activities reinforce learning across weeks
3. **Interactive Participation**: Members actively engage in discussions, problem-solving, and live demonstrations

## Cultural Significance

The Physics Society has become a cornerstone of our school’s scientific community. Students often report that attending even one session sparks curiosity that lasts all week. The society encourages critical thinking, collaboration, and an appreciation for the wonders of the universe.

## History and Legacy

The Physics Society was founded in 2025 by our president, Dr Aaron (“Dr. A”), who envisioned a space for students to explore mind‑bending thought experiments and interactive physics sessions. While still new, the society has already sparked curiosity and discussion among its members, and it promises to grow into a hub of scientific exploration and cosmic discovery within the school.

## Membership and Guidelines

All members of the Physics Society are expected to meet the following standards:

- Respect lab safety and equipment protocols
- Actively participate in discussions, experiments, and thought exercises
- Listen attentively to the session leader, engaging respectfully and raising questions at appropriate times
- Collaborate constructively with peers to foster a positive learning environment
- Document observations and reflect on learning to reinforce understanding

Remember: Participation in sessions is highly encouraged, and curiosity is essential. Following these guidelines ensures that every member can safely and effectively explore the frontiers of physics.
