	<h2>Our Founding and Legacy</h2>
	<p>
		The Physics Society was founded in 2025 by our president, Dr Aaron (“Dr. A”), with a vision to create an engaging space for students to explore physics through thought experiments, interactive sessions, and collaborative learning. Since its inception, the society has grown into a vibrant community encouraging curiosity and critical thinking.
	</p>

	<h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
	<p>
		At the Physics Society, we believe every student should have the opportunity to challenge their understanding of the universe. We emphasise hands-on experimentation, collaborative problem solving, and intellectual exploration to cultivate a deeper appreciation for physics.
	</p>

	<h2>Engaging Learning Experiences</h2>
	<p>
		Each session combines lectures, interactive experiments, and thought-provoking demonstrations. Our activities cover topics from classical mechanics to quantum phenomena, ensuring a stimulating environment for students of all levels.
	</p>

	<h2>Participation and Conduct</h2>
	<p>
		Members are expected to actively participate while respecting fellow students and the session leader. Interaction is encouraged, but students should wait their turn or raise a hand before speaking to maintain a focused and respectful environment.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Observe all lab safety protocols</li>
		<li>Engage thoughtfully with experiments and discussions</li>
		<li>Collaborate constructively with peers</li>
		<li>Document and reflect on learning</li>
		<li>Respect the session leader and classmates during presentations</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Research & Innovation</h2>
	<p>
		Our society actively encourages members to propose new experiments, explore emerging concepts in physics, and participate in school-wide demonstrations. Recent sessions have included solar system modelling, interactive optics experiments, and quantum simulations.
	</p>

	<h2>Community Impact</h2>
	<p>
		The Physics Society is committed to inspiring curiosity beyond its members. Through workshops, guest lectures, and collaborative projects, we aim to spark interest in science across the school and local community.
	</p>

	<h2>Awards & Recognition</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>School Excellence in Science Education Award</li>
		<li>Top Student-Led Society (2025)</li>
		<li>Outstanding Workshop Initiative</li>
		<li>Innovative Learning Environment Recognition</li>
		<li>Community Science Outreach Certificate</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
	<p>
		As the Physics Society grows, our mission remains to provide engaging, thought-provoking experiences for students. We aim to expand our activities, foster deeper collaboration, and inspire a lifelong interest in physics.
